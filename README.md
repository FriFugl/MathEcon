## Short rate models
### The Vasi훾ek model
This model has been implemented with the following dynamics

$$dr_{t} = (b - ar_{t})dt + \sigma dW_{t} \quad a>0.$$

It has an affine term structure, and ZCB prices can be represented as

$$p(t,T)=e^{A(t,T)-B(t,T)r_{t}},$$
where
$$B(t,T) = \frac{1}{a}\left(1-e^{-a(T-t)}\right),$$
$$A(t,T) = \frac{\left(B(t,T)-T+t\right)\left(ab-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\right)}{a^{2}} - \frac{\sigma^{2}B^{2}(t,T)}{4a}.$$

#### Simulation
Given parameters $r_{0}$, $a$, $b$, $\sigma$ and a time interval $[0,T]$ discretized by $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{n-1}<t_{n}=T$, it can be simulated using an exact scheme

$$r_{t_{i+1}} = r_{t_{i}}e^{-a(t_{i+1}-t_{i})} + \frac{b}{a}\left(1-e^{-a(t_{i+1}-t_{i})}\right) + \sigma\sqrt{\frac{1}{2a}\left(1-e^{-2a(t_{i+1}-t_{i})}\right)}z_{i+1},$$

or an Euler scheme (equivalent to a Milstein scheme in this case)

$$r_{t_{i+1}} = r_{t_{i}} + (b-ar_{t_{i}})(t_{i+1}-t_{i}) + \sigma \sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}z_{i+1}.$$

where $z_{i}$ is an i.i.d. sequence of standard normal random variables.

### Usage
#### Simulating the short rate
Here is an example of using the Vasi훾ek model from `_short_rate_models`
```
from _short_rate_models import VasicekModel
VasicekModel = VasicekModel(a=1, b=0.05, sigma=0.04) #Initiate model

# M = number of discretization points, N = number of paths, seed is a keyword argument
simulated_short_rates = VasicekModel.simulate(r_0=0.03, T=10, M=120, N=5, method='exact', seed=10)
```
which will create a $N\times M$ pandas dataframe such that each row corresponds to the trajectories of the short rate. Example result is plotted below.
```
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
for i, row in simulated_short_rates.iterrows():
    plt.plot(simulated_short_rates.columns, row, label=f'Trajectory {i+1}', alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel('$t$', fontsize=10)
plt.ylabel('$r_{t}$', fontsize=10).set_rotation(0)
plt.title('Simulation of 5 short rates in the Vasi훾ek model, seed = 10', fontsize=10)
plt.show()
```

#### Calculating ZCB prices, swap rates and accrual factors
With the short rates from the Vasi훾ek model we can calculate ZCB prices and swap details with
```
maturities = [i for i in range(11)]
ZCB_prices = VasicekModel.price_zcb(short_rates: simulated_short_rates,
                                    t=0,
                                    maturities=maturities)

T = 10 #Expiry of the swaps
entry_dates = [i for i in range(9)] #Entry dates of the swap
alpha = 1 #Time difference between payment of the fixed leg
swap_rates, accrual_factors = VasicekModel.swap_rate(short_rate=simulated_short_rates,
                                                         entry_dates=exercise_dates,
                                                         expiry=T,
                                                         alpha=alpha)
```
## Stock path models
### Geometric Brownian motion
The Geometric Bronian motion has the risk-neutral dynamics 

$$dS_{t}=rS_{t}dt+\sigma S_{t}dW_{t}$$

which has the following solution

$$S(t) = S(0)\exp\left(\left(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)t+\sigma W_{t}\right).$$

On a discretized time grid $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{n-1}<t_{n}=T$ it can be simulated using

$$S(t_{i+1}) = S(t_{i})\exp\left(\left(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)(t_{i+1}-t_{i})+\sigma\sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}z_{t_{i+1}}\right).$$

### Usage

From `_stock_path_models` we can simulate a Geometric Brownian Motion by
```
from _stock_path_models import GeometricBrownianMotion

#r = risk-free rate, sigma = volatility
GBM = GeometricBrownianMotion(r=0.06, sigma=0.4)
     
#s_0 = starting value, T = length of time interval, M = number of discretization points
#N = number of paths, seed is a keyword argument
stock_paths = GBM.simulate(s_0=36, T=1, M=50, N=5, seed = 10)      
```
which will produce these paths

## The Least Squares Monte Carlo method for pricing American options
### Classic Least Squares Monte Carlo method
In `_LSM` there is an implementation of the least squares monte carlo method as introduced in [Longstaff & Schwartz (2001)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~hjfurrer/teaching/LongstaffSchwartzAmericanOptionsLeastSquareMonteCarlo.pdf). It is too long to describe here, so I will refer to the original paper for details.

To demonstrate it, we can recreate a result from table 1 in the original paper, where they use the algorithm to price an american put option on a stock with a strike of 40.
```
import pandas as pd

from _helpers import _calculate_option_payoffs
from _helpers import _short_rate_to_discount_factors

from _LSM import LSM_method

from _stock_path_models import GeometricBrownianMotion

r = 0.06                                            #Risk-free rate
sigma = 0.2                                         #Volatility
strike = 40                                         #Option strike
s_0 = 36                                            #Initial stock value

T = 1                                               #Timespan in years
M = T*50                                            #Total number of exercise points (50 per year)
N = 100000                                          #Number of simulated stock paths
exercise_dates = [i*(T/M) for i in range(M+1)]      #Exercise dates

GBM = GeometricBrownianMotion(r=r, sigma=sigma)
stock_paths = GBM.simulate(s_0=s_0, T=T, M=M, N=N, seed=10)

short_rate = pd.DataFrame(r, index=stock_paths.index, columns=stock_paths.columns)
discount_factors = _short_rate_to_discount_factors(short_rates=short_rate)

LSM_model = LSM_method(strike=strike, exercise_dates=exercise_dates, basis_function=('laguerre',3))    
calibration_payoffs = _calculate_option_payoffs(stock_paths=stock_paths, strike=strike, call=False)
option_price, fitted_basis_functions = LSM_model.calibration(underlying_asset_paths=stock_paths,
                                                   payoffs=calibration_payoffs,
                                                   discount_factors=discount_factors)

print(f"Estimated option price: {option_price}")
```
giving an estimated option price of approximately 4.480 very much aligned with the original result. Note that in the above we use the calibration method, which returns an option price and fitted basis functions. To avoid in-sample bias, the method implemented can also run a forward path by using `LSM_method.estimation` which takes the same arguments as `LSM_method.calibration` and in addition the fitted basis functions.

#### Usage details
When initiating the LSM method it requres a fixed strike, a set of exercise dates and a tuple specifying the basis function to be used in the algorithm. The implementation allows for these types of polynomials as basis functions:
* Power
* Laguerre
* Chebyshev
* Legendre
* Hermite

To specify a polynomial of powers to the 2nd degree, you simple set `basis_function=('power',2)`.

When using either  `LSM_method.estimation` or `LSM_method.calibration` it requires a set of simulated assets paths depending on the type of option, which can be created using the simulation methods above and from these the payoffs can be calculated. The method also requires a dataframe of discount factors to continously discount the cashflow in the pricing method. These discount factors can be calculated from a dataframe of simulated short rates or a constant short rate using `_short_rate_to_discount_factors`.
