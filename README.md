# Least Squares Monte Carlo methods for American option pricing
This is an implementation of the least-squares monte carlo method developed by Longstaff & Schwartz to price american style options. It has been implemented to be capable of pricing American style options.

* `_processes` contains a class representing a stochastic process.
* `_short_rate_models` contains classes of short rate models to simulate short rate trajectories, calculate zero coupon bond prices and swap rates.
* `_stock_path_models` contains a class for the Geometric Brownian Motion process.
* `_LSM` contains classes for Least Squares Monte Carlo methods for option pricing.

## Short rate models
### The Vasi훾ek model
This model has been implemented with the following dynamics

$$dr_{t} = (b - ar_{t})dt + \sigma dW_{t} \quad a>0.$$

It has an affine term structure, and ZCB prices can be represented as

$$p(t,T)=e^{A(t,T)-B(t,T)r_{t}},$$
where
$$B(t,T) = \frac{1}{a}\left(1-e^{-a(T-t)}\right),$$
$$A(t,T) = \frac{\left(B(t,T)-T+t\right)\left(ab-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\right)}{a^{2}} - \frac{\sigma^{2}B^{2}(t,T)}{4a}.$$

#### Simulation
Given parameters $r_{0}$, $a$, $b$, $\sigma$ and a time interval $[0,T]$ discretized by $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{n-1}<t_{n}=T$, it can be simulated using an exact scheme

$$r_{t_{i+1}} = r_{t_{i}}e^{-a(t_{i+1}-t_{i})} + \frac{b}{a}\left(1-e^{-a(t_{i+1}-t_{i})}\right) + \sigma\sqrt{\frac{1}{2a}\left(1-e^{-2a(t_{i+1}-t_{i})}\right)}z_{i+1},$$

or an Euler scheme (equivalent to a Milstein scheme in this case)

$$r_{t_{i+1}} = r_{t_{i}} + (b-ar_{t_{i}})(t_{i+1}-t_{i}) + \sigma \sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}z_{i+1}.$$

where $z_{i}$ is an i.i.d. sequence of standard normal random variables.

### Usage
#### Simulating the short rate
Here is an example of using the Vasi훾ek model from `_short_rate_models`
```
from _short_rate_models import VasicekModel
VasicekModel = VasicekModel(a=1, b=0.05, sigma=0.04) #Initiate model

# M = number of discretization points, N = number of paths, seed is a keyword argument
simulated_short_rates = VasicekModel.simulate(r_0=0.03, T=10, M=120, N=5, method='exact', seed=10)
```
which will create a $N\times M$ pandas dataframe such that each row corresponds to the trajectories of the short rate. Example result is plotted below.
```
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
for i, row in simulated_short_rates.iterrows():
    plt.plot(simulated_short_rates.columns, row, label=f'Trajectory {i+1}', alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel('$t$', fontsize=10)
plt.ylabel('$r_{t}$', fontsize=10).set_rotation(0)
plt.title('Simulation of 5 short rates in the Vasi훾ek model, seed = 10', fontsize=10)
plt.show()
```

#### Calculating ZCB prices, swap rates and accrual factors
With the short rates from the Vasi훾ek model we can calculate ZCB prices and swap details with
```
maturities = [i for i in range(11)]
ZCB_prices = VasicekModel.price_zcb(short_rates: simulated_short_rates,
                                    t=0,
                                    maturities=maturities)

T = 10 #Expiry of the swaps
entry_dates = [i for i in range(9)] #Entry dates of the swap
alpha = 1 #Time difference between payment of the fixed leg
swap_rates, accrual_factors = VasicekModel.swap_rate(short_rate=simulated_short_rates,
                                                         entry_dates=exercise_dates,
                                                         expiry=T,
                                                         alpha=alpha)
```
## Stock path models
### Geometric Brownian motion
The Geometric Bronian motion has the risk-neutral dynamics 

$$dS_{t}=rS_{t}dt+\sigma S_{t}dW_{t}$$

which has the following solution

$$S(t) = S(0)\exp\left(\left(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)t+\sigma W_{t}\right).$$

On a discretized time grid $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{n-1}<t_{n}=T$ it can be simulated using

$$S(t_{i+1}) = S(t_{i})\exp\left(\left(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)(t_{i+1}-t_{i})+\sigma\sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}z_{t_{i+1}}\right).$$

### Usage

From `_stock_path_models` we can simulate a Geometric Brownian Motion by
```
from _stock_path_models import GeometricBrownianMotion

#r = risk-free rate, sigma = volatility
GBM = GeometricBrownianMotion(r=0.06, sigma=0.4)
     
#s_0 = starting value, T = length of time interval, M = number of discretization points
#N = number of paths, seed is a keyword argument
stock_paths = GBM.simulate(s_0=36, T=1, M=50, N=5, seed = 10)      
```
which will produce these paths
